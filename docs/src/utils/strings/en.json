  "townHall.description": "Every villager in town gathers at the town to discuss Mafia suspects. No villager misses this daily ritual since it might cause others to believe they are in the Mafia. Everyone will discuss the importance of keeping the village safe as well as which villagers they suspect of being in the Mafia. When you reach a consensus of who the most suspicious person is, select your choice from the list of people on your phone, and confirm. The debate will continue until a consensus is reached. Once the voting is over, the suspect will be hanged. Then the people of the town will return to their homes, go about the rest of their day, and eventually fall asleep for the night. At this point, you will close your eyes, and the game will continue.",

The people of the town have heard that these Mafia members make a living on stealing, bribing, and killing. The problem is that no one can tell who the Mafia members are, since they blend so well into society. In an effort to appease the people, town hall meetings have been scheduled every day, so that citizens may debate and discuss who they believe is a member of Mafia. The town has granted the people the authority to hang a person suspected of being in the Mafia if the whole town reaches a consensus on who they wish to hang. May the odds be in your favor!",
